# GettingAndCleaningData
course work for Getting and Cleaning Data

This code will take several text files which contain measurements of 30 different people while they are performing 6 different activities.

This code will first read the data and then merge the training and the test sets together.  It will label the activity with descriptive names & label the data set with the relative measurement names.

It will extract only the measurements that represent the mean and the standard deviation.

In the final step,it will create a new tidy data set which aggregrates the data by activity and subject and finds the means of each of the measurements.
